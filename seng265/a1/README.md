## Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to interpret and format iCalendar data into a more readable format. I learned the C language from scratch and among other things learned how to use Vim, Git, the debugger, and created a program that worked efficiently and effectively.

## Note
- my code: `icsout.c` except for lines 250-272
