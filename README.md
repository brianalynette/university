Here you will find any assignments/projects worked on at UVic

This includes my work from second year learning to code in C, and extending my Python knowledge. I have also included some work from my third year where we created out own process managers, implemented our own process schedulers, and outputs for FAT12 file systems.

Clarification on code I wrote vs what was provided for me:
- In all seng265 folders I wrote the code for the `icsout_._` files, however all other code was written by my professor (the tester files and .ics files).
- In seng265/a1/iscout.c I wrote all code except for lines 250-272.
- In csc360/a1, I wrote PMan.c, all other code was provided for me.
- In csc360/a2, I wrote any files with a `.c` or `.h` extension, and all remaining files where provided by my professor.
